# picotron-distributions
Adds support for custom distributions into Picotron

To make a custom distribution, simply ensure your `boot.lua` is named `custom_boot.lua` and put it into `/distributions`!

You can generate a distribution based on the active `/system` by running this program again.

Installing through this also gives you the `bios` terminal utility, rebooting the system and entering the BIOS.
